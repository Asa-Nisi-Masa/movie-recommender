        Instructions for preparing your ratings
    </h1>
    <p>
        Movies are recommended based on your ratings. To prepare your IMDb ratings do the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Login to your IMDb account</li>
            <li>Go to 'Your Ratings'</li>
            <li>Look for the three vertical dots â‹®</li>
            <li>Click and choose 'Export'</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Alternatively, you can prepare your own ratings file. For that you need two columns:
        <ul>
            <li>'Const' or 'IMDbId' with IMDb movie ids</li>
            <li>'Your Rating' with a 1-10 rating for each movie</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
